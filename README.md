# SentinelOne_ThreatIntelAPI_JSON_Generator
The SentinelOne IOC JSON Generator is a web-based tool that allows users to manually input Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and generate properly formatted JSON data for use with the SentinelOne API. It supports one or more entries, a structured optional fields section, and a built-in webhook submission feature to submit via a Webhook with Hyper Automation or directly to the SentienlOne API.
